### Can Static sites become the de-facto web trend?

Static sites are becoming a popular site solution. Having dabbled with WordPress and other CMS' it seemed interesting to try out some static site generation.

I'd thought I would give jekyll a go and found jekyll-bootstrap for blogging. I've since then stripped away most of the JB stuff and customised it myself, but if you don't want to do this, I'd recommend trying out jekyll-bootstrap if you want to get started.


Great examples on github, especially pages like Moz Morris.

Blogging like this is great way to get into jekyll, markdown and github pages.

Some reference below - there's a ton out there!
