# Font Awesome

Forget images for icons, web fonts are the way to go!

They scale easily, no need to worry about retina sizing, image handling or processing.

A great resource for web fonts is [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/).

It's a resource that ties in neatly with Twitter Bootstrap, but you can use it outwith Bootstrap too.
