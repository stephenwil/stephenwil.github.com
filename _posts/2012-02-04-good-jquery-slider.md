A recent web development task was to show a number of banners on the home page of a site, but the banners had to be displayed on a container that would suit interactions with both desktop & mobile users.

In amongst suitable candidates we looked at iScroll, but it proved problematic in IE.

We settled on Flexslider – really good configurable jQuery slider.

I’ve forked it on GitHub, as we’ve made a few improvements.

(Since this post was written, [FlexSlider2](https://github.com/woothemes/flexslider) has come out and supersedes any changes we put in on our fork)
